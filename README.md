A SMTP Server to send bulk mails

Bulky is a friendly guide for beginners to set up their own SMTP server to send bulk mails.

I get asked a lot, why to run your own SMTP server?
Pro: No sending volume limits. Many email service providers and internet service providers (ISPs) limit your daily emails, as do some web hosts. When you have your own dedicated SMTP, you can send as many emails as you need on an hourly or daily basis.
Pro: Fully monitor email delivery. No matter what happens to your email after you hit send, you will receive helpful delivery information. You can see if your messages were sent to the recipient and examine any error codes.
Pro: Your email list is private. Another advantage of running your own SMTP is that you don’t have to share email list information with anyone, maintaining your company’s and your customer’s data privacy.


When we say unlimited emails, this means that we can send unlimited emails from our server, there are no restrictions by companies or monthly plans to buy or so.

It's your own server, u can send as much your server can handle in terms of resources. so when you have more (CPU and RAM), you can send more emails and so on.
